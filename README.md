# Mail Merger
As part of a mini-project aimed at automating the process of generating personalized letters, I developed a Python script utilizing file handling and string manipulation. The project involved reading a list of invitee names and a template letter, then dynamically replacing placeholders with the invitee's name to create individualized letters.This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming, particularly in the following areas-
## File Handling: 
Successfully read and wrote multiple files, ensuring efficient data handling and manipulation.
## String Manipulation:
Utilized Python's string methods to replace placeholders in the template with actual names, demonstrating attention to detail and precision in text processing.
## Automation: 
Automated a repetitive task, significantly reducing the manual effort and time required for creating personalized letters.
The resulting script not only streamlined the mail merge process but also highlighted my ability to implement practical solutions for real-world problems using Python.
